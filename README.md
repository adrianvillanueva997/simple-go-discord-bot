# simple-go-discord-bot
Just a simple discord bot made in golang as an excuse to learn more about go.

Some libraries are needed, you can find them in main.go in the import thing.

For now, It only supports a simple command (!cat) and allows sending messages if certain word was found in a message.

# To-do
Add routines to launch commands at certain times and add more stuff
